* Use a unique name if creating an asset. Short names are preferred, but if needed use long names.
* If creating an asset of a real world assets like real estate, provide clear and precise information for the Asset Name&#x20;

Asset Data

This section is for the asset data or metadata. The information provided here helps to give validity to the Asset and its value. The asset data has to be precise, complete and should enable anyone to check authenticity of the asset its backing. The data provided will depend on the digital or physical asset which is being created as a blockchain Asset. &#x20;

Ex: If creating an Asset of a digital art, which basically is an image file, provide a md5 hash of the original image for anyone to check the authenticity of that particular file. If all the details are provided without the file hash, the asset will not be of any use due to the fact that no one will be able to confirm the authenticity of the file which represents the asset

{% hint style="info" %}
Asset data has a limit of 1KB and this is binding. An asset can contain around 990 - 995 characters including spaces.
{% endhint %}

In the image the Asset Data is entered in fields which represent a single line. First field is the name of the field and next is the value.&#x20;

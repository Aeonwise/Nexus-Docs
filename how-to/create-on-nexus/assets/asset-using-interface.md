Here you have two main sections "Asset Name" and "Asset Data".

Asset Name has a fee of 1NXS. Users can opt not to create an Asset Name and can use the register address to access or search the Asset.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Naming Convention:\

{% endhint %}

* Use a unique name if creating an asset. Short names are preferred, but if needed use long names.
* If creating an asset of a real world assets like real estate, provide clear and precise information for the Asset Name&#x20;
* If creating a bunch of NFT's say from a single art collection, then suffix the collection name with a unique serial Number series Ex: "_Iron Maiden #0001"_

Asset Data

This section is for the asset data or metadata. The information provided here helps to give validity to the Asset and its value. The asset data has to be precise, complete and should enable anyone to check authenticity of the asset its backing. The data provided will depend on the digital or physical asset which is being created as a blockchain Asset. &#x20;

Ex: If creating an Asset of a digital art, which basically is an image file, provide a md5 hash of the original image for anyone to check the authenticity of that particular file. If all the details are provided without the file hash, the asset will not be of any use due to the fact that no one will be able to confirm the authenticity of the file which represents the asset

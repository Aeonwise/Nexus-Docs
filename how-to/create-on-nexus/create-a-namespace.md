# Create a Namespace

This guide will help users to create a Namespace using the Nexus Interface

Before we start to create a Namespace, users need to be familiar with the concept and usage.

### NAMESPACE:

Namespaces allow users to provide user-friendly names for their object registers without needing to disclose their username. This is useful for privacy, but also to allow names to be related to a business or some other meaningful context.&#x20;

To avoid name-squatting registering a namespace attracts a high fee (`1000 NXS`). However once registered, creating Names within that namespace costs only `1 NXS`

**NOTE** : Namespaces can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and periods **** (**.**).

### `Uses of Namespace`

`Namespaces can be used for a few things:`

* `It can be used as a company name, a layer above the user account. All the transactions can be done by sending the transactions to namespace::account.`
* `It can provide privacy by hiding the username for the Sigchain`
* `In the future it can be used as Domain Name for websites hosted on Nexus Cloud`

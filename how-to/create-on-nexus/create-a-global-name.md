# Create a Global Name



This guide will help users to create a Global Name using the Nexus Interface

Before we start to create a Global Name, users need to be familiar with the concept and usage.

### Global Name:

Global Names require no username or namespace prefix, and are therefore globally unique. These will be likely reserved for use cases where a succinct, unique, name is necessary, for example a token ticker symbol. To avoid needless name-squatting, global names attract a high fee (`2000 NXS`).

### Name Parameters

#### Name Field

In this field the user provides the global name to be created.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Creating a Global name will incur a fee of 2000 NXS. The fees will be deducted from the default account.
{% endhint %}

#### Register Address

In this field the user provides the register address of the token that will be linked to the global name.&#x20;

## Create a Name

To create a Name using the Interface follow the steps:

* Open the Nexus Interface, make sure the wallet is fully synched and log into the user account (Sigchain).
* In the Overview page, at the bottom click on the "_User"_ module. This opens the User page.
* In the User page, on the left side click on the "Name_s_" tab.
* In the Names page click on "_Create a new name_". This opens the "Create a new name" page.
* On top of the page make sure the "GLOBAL" button is highlighted, if not click on it.&#x20;
* In this page the user has to provide the "Name" and the "register address" to which it points .&#x20;
* Once the parameters are provided, click on the "CREATE NAME" button on the bottom of the page.

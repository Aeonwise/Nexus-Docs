# Create a Global Name

### Global Name:

Global Names require no username or namespace prefix, and are therefore globally unique. These will be likely reserved for use cases where a succinct, unique, name is necessary, for example a token ticker symbol. To avoid needless name-squatting, global names attract a high fee (`2000 NXS`).

Creating a Global name will incur a fee of 2000 NXS. The fees will be deducted from the default account.

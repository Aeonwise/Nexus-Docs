# Consensus on Nexus

### What is consensus?

A blockchain, or distributed ledger, is spread across nodes whose job it is to verify transactions on the network. This is one of the key ideas about blockchain, and gives it its unique decentralized flavor.

As a result, anyone can submit information to be stored onto a blockchain and therefore it is important that there are processes in place that can ensure everyone agrees on what information to add and what to discard. These rules, are essentially known as consensus protocols. They verify transactions and help keep the network safe.&#x20;

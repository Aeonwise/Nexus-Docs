# Consensus on Nexus

### What is consensus?

A blockchain, or distributed ledger, is spread across nodes whose job it is to verify transactions on the network. This is one of the key ideas about blockchain, and gives it its unique decentralized flavor.

As a result, anyone can submit information to be stored onto a blockchain and therefore it is important that there are processes in place that can ensure everyone agrees on what information to add and what to discard. These rules, are essentially known as consensus protocols. They verify transactions and help keep the network safe.&#x20;

### How do Consensus Protocols work?

The consensus protocol at the heart of a blockchain network gives a specific method for verifying whether a transaction is true or not. It provides a method of review and confirmation of what data should be added to a blockchain's record. Because blockchain networks typically don't have a centralized authority dictating who is right or wrong, nodes on a blockchain all must agree on the state of the network, following the predefined rules, or protocol.

For Bitcoin, the consensus protocol is Proof-of work (PoW), the block mining process which confirms each transaction. Other types of consensus protocol include Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA).

## Nexus Consensus:

Nexus has 3 channel consensus. First two are mining channels Prime and Hash, third is the nPoS staking channel

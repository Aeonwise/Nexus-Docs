**Funding**

No, Nexus is one of the few blockchains that was created from scratch, and mined into existence (like Bitcoin). You can learn more about NXS on our our website's Economics page.

The Nexus Embassies are funded by a portion of each block that is mined. The NXS automatically transfers into embassy keys.

We are a diverse network of individuals who advocate the following principles:

* **Responsibility & Independence:** Decentralized Systems have the ability to provide choices to become more independent from existing systems, which are often centralized and reliant on outdated processes.
* **Decentralization & Meritocracy:** Decentralization of power and resources is fundamental to building the foundations of a meritocracy, where people are rewarded in proportion to their merit.
* **Information & Exchange:** The technology of Nexus is developed for people to have free access to information and exchange, creating the potential for greater novelty.
* **Honesty & Transparency:** Honesty nurtures trust between people, allowing us to be more effective as a group, whilst transparency cultivates integrity.

# Receive NXS



To receive NXS from another sender or an exchange such as Binance or Bittrex, or to receive a Token, go to the User module, and please follow the below instructions:

1. Go to the Account page.
2. Choose the recipient account.
3. Select the Copy to clipboard icon.
4. Send the copied address to the sender, or paste the address into your exchange Wallet. Tritium enables the use of username:account (case sensitive) in this image below will be sirius:default, this makes it really easy for new users to transact and also avoids mistakes when copying the hex address. (This cannot be used to transfer from exchanges as they still use legacy chain).

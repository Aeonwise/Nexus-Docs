# Create an Account

You can create as many accounts as you wish within your main user account, for the use of NXS or any other Token issued on the Nexus blockchain. Accounts are free to create, however if you choose to give your account a name (so that you can give out an easy readable address, rather than a hexadecimal address), then a fee of 1 NXS is applied.

To create a new Named account, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the User module
2. Accounts tab
3. Create new account

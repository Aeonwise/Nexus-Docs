# NEXUSINTERFACE

## **Introduction**

NexusInterface is the official implementation of the embedded `Core` with a user interface which helps ordinary users to store and transact NXS, tokens, assets and more. NXS the cryptocurrency powering the network is not compatible with any other third-party wallet or hardware wallets due to the disparate architecture that manages keys and assets on-chain, resembling a cloud services, along with increased security standards compared to other blockchains (512 bit keys compared to 256 bit keys).

NexusInterface is modular and consists of the _`Core`_ and the _`Interface`._ This helps ordinary users to run the Interface and empowers advanced users to run the core as a daemon on servers or headless machines and to access using the Interface. The Interface empowers ordinary users to carry out varied Interface functions and additional features can be enabled by the use of modules in a safe sandboxed environment.

The Interface supports both, Tritium and the old Legacy chain.&#x20;

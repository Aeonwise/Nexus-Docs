# Create a User Account

Before creating a new user account, your Wallet must be fully synchronized with the Nexus Blockchain. See [Bootstrap and Synchronize](https://nexus.io/ResourceHub/wallet-guide#bootstrap) if this still needs to be completed.

To create your user account, simply choose a username, password, and PIN.

{% hint style="info" %}
User Accounts on Nexus are also referred as Signature Chains
{% endhint %}

Username: It must be at least 3 characters long and itâ€™s case sensitive. Examples: Oliver Queen, Oliver.Queen, oliverqueen. We recommend keeping the username simple, because it is the easiest way to transact on Tritium (username:default will be the address to receive nxs or tokens. Example: Oliver Queen:default).

Password: It must be at least 8 characters. It can contain lower and upper case alphabets, numerals from 0-9 and special characters.

PIN: It must be at least 4 digits. It can contain alphanumeric and special characters, and can be used as a second password.

When you submit your create new user request, your Wallet must complete a small proof of work that may take up to 30 seconds. Then, it will create your Signature Chain and submit it for processing. **You cannot log in with your new user account until after this processing is complete and your Signature Chain is added to the Nexus Blockchain.** This may happen with the next new block added, or it may take more than one block.

Typically, it should take less than 5 minutes, after which you can log into your Wallet and access your new user account.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**PLEASE DO NOT USE COMMON WORDS FOR YOUR PASSWORD, THIS WILL LEAVE YOU VULNERABLE TO DICTIONARY ATTACKS THAT COULD DRASTICALLY DECREASE THIS RESISTANCE.**

We therefore recommend that you use a secure [random number generator](https://nexus.io/ResourceHub/wallet-guide#random-password-generator) to create your password.

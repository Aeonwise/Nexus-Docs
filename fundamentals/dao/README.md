What is Governance?

Governance can be defined as: “The system by which entities, networks are directed and controlled. It is concerned with structure and processes for decision making, accountability, control and behaviour at the top of an entity. Governance influences how an organisation’s objectives are set and achieved, how risk is monitored and addressed and how performance is optimised”. Governance is a system and process, not a single activity and therefore successful implementation of a good governance strategy requires a systematic approach that incorporates strategic planning, risk management and performance management. Like culture, it is a core component of the unique characteristics of a successful organisation.

### Why do we need Governance?

Every society, organisation or network need some type of governance to survive and thrive. History has seen the experimentation of different type of governance models, which ultimately have failed and as we are all well aware today the democratic governance systems we live in are breaking down. The disparity between the rich and the poor is very huge and its creating a lot of economic unrest.&#x20;

The crypto universe has introduced to the DAO concept, has been hailed as the holy grail which will redeem humanity, but havent seen any good models.

### What is a DAO?

Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires a lot of trust in the people you're working with. But it’s hard to trust someone you’ve only ever interacted with on the internet. With DAOs you don’t need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAO’s code, which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone.

A way of organizing with other people around the world, without knowing each other and establishing your own rules, and making your own decisions autonomously all encoded on a Blockchain? Well, DAOs are making this real.

### Social Stack and Starfish:

The Nexus DAO is based on the social stack; which is a new concept in social structure of the future. The goal of the social stack was to build a new type of governance structure which not only suits the Nexus network, but also to be used in real world for any decentralized organisation, society or network to empower people.&#x20;

Nexus has designed the DAO organisation structure to resemble the starfish; decentralized network, No head, major organs are replicated throughout each arm. Cut it in half and you get two starfish.

A new social structure has to be vetted, tested in its natural habitat and we have launched the organisation as a group of people, testing every functionality and fine tuning it before programming it mathematically into the Nexus protocols. The onchain DAO is scheduled for release with the 7.0 update.

Nexus is building DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) technology based on mathematical regulation to improve the overall network governance model. The technology will enable groups that share similar knowledge and interests to vote together on subject matters that they have expertise in. By encapsulating values that are alike into groups that determine a smaller part of the entire decision itself, we can improve the overall reflection of value in a system as a whole. This concept can be observed in the human body: the lungs value certain resources over the stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, although they all work together as components of a decentralized system to form the basis of a healthy body.

_”The dilemma is not that people have conflicting value systems, but rather that they are usually required to decide together in one group. We believe the best way to enforce the keys is by a public vote on their issuance.”_

This is an important step towards the longer term sustainability of our Ecosystem, and the creation of direct accountability of those who are paid to complete work on behalf of the community. In order to fully maintain an active contract, Ambassadors or Developers will be required to uphold the utmost transparency, accountability, and performance necessary for continued support. Mathematically enforced management of the funds will prevent the mismanagement of funds, corruption, coercion, and complacency that can arise in growing organizations.

# Web 3.0

Web 3.0(Also known as Web3) is the next iteration of the world wide web. which incorporates concepts including decentralization and token-based economics.&#x20;



### BACKGROUND

#### **What is Web 1.0?** <a href="#what-is-web-1-0" id="what-is-web-1-0"></a>

Web 1.0 was the first iteration of the web. Most participants were consumers of content, and the creators were typically developers who build websites that contained information served up mainly in text or image format. Web 1.0 lasted approximately from 1991 to 2004.

Web 1.0 consisted of sites serving static content instead of dynamic HTML. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn't have much interactivity at all.

You can think of Web 1.0 as the read-only web.

#### **What is Web 2.0?** <a href="#what-is-web-2-0" id="what-is-web-2-0"></a>

Most of us have primarily experienced the web in its current form, commonly referred to as web2. You can think of web2 as the interactive and social web.

In the web2 world, you don’t have to be a developer to participate in the creation process. Many apps are built in a way that easily allows anyone to be a creator.

If you want to craft a thought and share it with the world, you can. If you want to upload a video and allow millions of people to see it, interact with it, and comment on it, you can do that too.

Web2 is simple, really, and because of its simplicity more and more people around the world are becoming creators.

The web in its current form is really great in many ways, but there are some areas where we can do a lot better.

You can think of Web 2.0 as the read- write web.

#### **Web 2.0 (2005-present)**

Web 2.0 also called the read/write internet. The Social Web, or Web 2.0, made the internet a lot more interactive thanks to advancements in web technologies like Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, etc., which enabled startups to build interactive web platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia and many more.

This paved the way for both social networks and user-generated content production to flourish since data can now be distributed and shared between various platforms and applications.

Why Web 3.0?

Web 3 can be understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the Internet. Rather than just using free tech platforms in exchange for our data, users can participate in the governance and operation of the protocols themselves. This means people can become participants and shareholders, not just customers or products.

&#x20;It is currently still being built, so there is no single, established definition yet of what Web 3 is or will be.

In general, however, Web 3 refers to an Internet that is made possible by decentralized networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The key innovation of these networks is the creation of platforms that no single entity controls, yet everyone can still trust. That’s because every user and operator of these networks must follow the same set of hard-coded rules, known as [consensus protocols](https://decrypt.co/resources/consensus-protocols-what-are-they-guide-how-to-explainer).&#x20;

The secondary innovation is that these networks allow value or money to be transferred between accounts. These two things—decentralization and Internet money—are the keys to understanding Web 3.



### **Problems with web 2**

The birth of the web was hailed as democratise and empower people and make knowledge readily and freely available, but somehow the internet has turned into a fully centralised network, controlled by a few entities and due to the vast power they wield on lives of people.

Web 2.0 was driven by the advent of mobile, social media, cloud, E-commerce and sharing economy. It has given rise to new type of business opportunities.

Although Web 2 has brought the world amazing free services, a lot of people have grown tired of the new “walled gardens” these huge tech companies have created and want to have more control over their data and content.

Concerns with web 2.0

#### Net neutrality:&#x20;

It is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.

With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.

* Privacy
* Big tech censorship and data mining
* Gated Internet totally controlled by govt
* Internet cyber attacks
* Internet routing issues

&#x20;Web 2.0, wherein the data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech". The term was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital firms.



Cons of Social Media

* Information overload. Too much information is daily posted by many people with different thoughts. This creates confusion for the readers and the quality of the content is not reliable.
* Freedom to post views and comments provides good opportunities for competitors and rivals to post negative comments about other companies.
* Too many fake ids and spammers.
* Forgeries and hackers commit crimes.

## What is Web 3.0?

Web 3 can be understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the Internet. There are a few fundamental differences between web2 and web3, but decentralization is at its core.

Web3 Enables Ownership

One of the driving forces and the one that resonates with most people (and me) is that Web3 enables ownership.

Web3 enhances the internet as we know it today with a few other added characteristics. web3 is:

Verifiable

Trustless

Self-governing

Permissionless

Distributed and robust

Stateful

Native built-in payments

Where Web 2.0 was driven by the advent of mobile, social and cloud, Web 3.0 is built largely on four new layers of technological innovations: **decentralized protocol blockchains**, **edge computing**, **decentralized data networks** and **artificial intelligence**.\

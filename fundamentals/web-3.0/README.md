# Web 3.0

Web 3.0(Also known as Web3) is the next iteration of the world wide web. which incorporates concepts including decentralization and token-based economics.&#x20;

Web 3.0 will fundamentally expand the scale & scope of both human and machine interactions far beyond what we can imagine today. These interactions, ranging from seamless payments to richer information flows, to trusted data transfers, will become possible with a vastly increased range of potential counterparties. Web 3.0 will enable us to interact with any individual or machine in the world, without having to pass through fee-charging middlemen. This shift will enable a whole new wave of previously unimaginable businesses and business models: from global co-operatives to decentralised autonomous organisations and self-sovereign data marketplaces.

### BACKGROUND

#### **What is Web 1.0?** <a href="#what-is-web-1-0" id="what-is-web-1-0"></a>

Web 1.0 was the first iteration of the web. Most participants were consumers of content, and the creators were typically developers who build websites that contained information served up mainly in text or image format. Web 1.0 lasted approximately from 1991 to 2004.

Web 1.0 consisted of sites serving static content instead of dynamic HTML. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn't have much interactivity at all.

You can think of Web 1.0 as the read-only web.

#### **What is Web 2.0?** <a href="#what-is-web-2-0" id="what-is-web-2-0"></a>

Most of us have primarily experienced the web in its current form, commonly referred to as web2. You can think of web2 as the interactive and social web.

In the web2 world, you don’t have to be a developer to participate in the creation process. Many apps are built in a way that easily allows anyone to be a creator.

If you want to craft a thought and share it with the world, you can. If you want to upload a video and allow millions of people to see it, interact with it, and comment on it, you can do that too.

Web2 is simple, really, and because of its simplicity more and more people around the world are becoming creators.

The web in its current form is really great in many ways, but there are some areas where we can do a lot better.

You can think of Web 2.0 as the read- write web.

#### **Web 2.0 (2005-present)**

Web 2.0 also called the read/write internet. The Social Web, or Web 2.0, made the internet a lot more interactive thanks to advancements in web technologies like Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, etc., which enabled startups to build interactive web platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia and many more.

This paved the way for both social networks and user-generated content production to flourish since data can now be distributed and shared between various platforms and applications.

Why Web 3.0?

Web 3 can be understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the Internet. Rather than just using free tech platforms in exchange for our data, users can participate in the governance and operation of the protocols themselves. This means people can become participants and shareholders, not just customers or products.

&#x20;It is currently still being built, so there is no single, established definition yet of what Web 3 is or will be.

In general, however, Web 3 refers to an Internet that is made possible by decentralized networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The key innovation of these networks is the creation of platforms that no single entity controls, yet everyone can still trust. That’s because every user and operator of these networks must follow the same set of hard-coded rules, known as [consensus protocols](https://decrypt.co/resources/consensus-protocols-what-are-they-guide-how-to-explainer).&#x20;

The secondary innovation is that these networks allow value or money to be transferred between accounts. These two things—decentralization and Internet money—are the keys to understanding Web 3.



### **Problems with web 2**

The birth of the web was hailed as democratise and empower people and make knowledge readily and freely available, but somehow the internet has turned into a fully centralised network, controlled by a few entities and due to the vast power they wield on lives of people.

Web 2.0 was driven by the advent of mobile, social media, cloud, E-commerce and sharing economy. It has given rise to new type of business opportunities.

Although Web 2 has brought the world amazing free services, a lot of people have grown tired of the new “walled gardens” these huge tech companies have created and want to have more control over their data and content.

Concerns with web 2.0

#### Net neutrality:&#x20;

It is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.

With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.

* Privacy
* Big tech censorship and data mining
* Gated Internet totally controlled by govt
* Internet cyber attacks
* Internet routing issues

&#x20;Web 2.0, wherein the data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech". The term was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital firms.

**Web 2.0** radically shrunk the latency and cost at which people & businesses could trade  information & work with geographically distributed counterparties they didn’t necessarily know, via trusted intermediaries. Truly global businesses started to form, as the reach of counterparties expanded by a few orders of magnitude. At its heart, today’s internet allows global coordination via a set of intermediaries, providing a digital social trust layer for strangers to interact: from Facebook, to eBay & AirBnB. Unfortunately we’ve become overly dependent on these platforms, and when they move from “attract” to “extract”, their users (whether individuals or businesses) suffer via higher fees or platform risk (i.e. the platform has the power to destroy your business running on it). While today’s interactions might magically and reliably take place on a global scale, it is predominantly the $200Bn digital advertising business, with ‘we the users’ as the product, which fuels this machine. It is now also broadly understood that these platforms of the ‘post truth’ world have created echo-chambers within which unfiltered and unashamedly populist or indeed fallacious claims reverberate and reinforce — sometimes with chaotic consequences.&#x20;



## What is Web 3.0?

Web 3 can be understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the Internet. There are a few fundamental differences between web2 and web3, but decentralization is at its core.

Web3 Enables Ownership

One of the driving forces and the one that resonates with most people (and me) is that Web3 enables ownership.

\


Web3 enhances the internet as we know it today with a few other added characteristics. web3 is:

Verifiable

Trustless

Self-governing

Permissionless

Distributed and robust

Stateful

Native built-in payments

Where Web 2.0 was driven by the advent of mobile, social and cloud, Web 3.0 is built largely on four new layers of technological innovations: **decentralized protocol blockchains**, **edge computing**, **decentralized data networks** and **artificial intelligence**.\


Web 3 will only be feasible with the evolution of blockchains, with their decentralised, scalable and trustless properties will be the foundation for coordination at a global scale. web3 will not only enable human to human but also human to machine and machine to machine interactions which will enable them to trade data and value.

Web 3.0 will fundamentally expand the scale & scope of both human and machine interactions far beyond what we can imagine today. Web 3.0 will enable us to interact with any individual or machine in the world, without having to pass through fee-charging middlemen. This shift will enable a whole new wave of previously unimaginable businesses and business models: from global co-operatives to decentralised autonomous organisations and self-sovereign data marketplaces

DAO will play a great role in the governance of the web3 landscape and this will help to upgrade the advancement of the web3 ecosystem&#x20;



With **Web 3.0**, **** women, men, machines & businesses will be able to trade value, information & work with global counterparties they don’t know or yet explicitly trust, without an intermediary. The most important evolution enabled by Web3.0 is the minimisation of the trust required for coordination on a global scale. **This marks a move towards trusting all constituents of a network **_**implicitly**_** rather than needing to trust each individual **_**explicitly**_** and/or seeking to achieve trust **_**extrinsically**_**.**

Web 3.0 will fundamentally expand the scale & scope of both human and machine interactions far beyond what we can imagine today. These interactions, ranging from seamless payments to richer information flows, to trusted data transfers, will become possible with a vastly increased range of potential counterparties. Web 3.0 will enable us to interact with any individual or machine in the world, without having to pass through fee-charging middlemen. This shift will enable a whole new wave of previously unimaginable businesses and business models: from global co-operatives to decentralised autonomous organisations and self-sovereign data marketplaces.

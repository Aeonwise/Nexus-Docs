A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger.

A medium of exchange is anything widely accepted as payment for goods and services, and a ledger is a data store that keeps track of transactions. Blockchain technology allows users to make transactions on the ledger without reliance upon a trusted third party to maintain the ledger.

The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since Bitcoin's release in 2009, people have made thousands of cryptocurrencies across many different blockchains.

### WHAT IS NEXUS? <a href="#what-is-ether" id="what-is-ether"></a>

Nexus (NXS) is the cryptocurrency powering the Nexus network and is the only acceptable form of payment. NXS has been mined into existance wit he 3 channel consensus. Nexus has designed the network to work with free simple transactions, but there are various operation and anti spam features which require the use of NXS.&#x20;

Developers can build decentralised applications(dapps) using the REST API. NXS allows the developers pay for the various operation on the network to make

NXS is also use to compensate miners and stakers who secure the network and provide computing resources

# ðŸ’µ Intro to NXS

### WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY? <a href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency" id="what-is-a-cryptocurrency"></a>

A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger.

A medium of exchange is anything widely accepted as payment for goods and services, and a ledger is a data store that keeps track of transactions. Blockchain technology allows users to make transactions on the ledger without reliance upon a trusted third party to maintain the ledger.

The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since Bitcoin's release in 2009, people have made thousands of cryptocurrencies across many different blockchains.

### WHAT IS NEXUS? <a href="#what-is-ether" id="what-is-ether"></a>

Nexus (NXS) is the cryptocurrency powering the Nexus network and is the only acceptable form of payment. NXS has been mined into existance wit he 3 channel consensus. Nexus has designed the network to work with free simple transactions, but there are various operation and anti spam features which require the use of NXS.&#x20;

Developers can build decentralised applications(dapps) using the REST API. NXS allows the developers pay for the various operation on the network to make

NXS is also use to compensate miners and stakers who secure the network and provide computing resources

**Ether (ETH)** is the cryptocurrency used for many things on the Ethereum network. Fundamentally, it is the only acceptable form of payment for transaction fees, and after [the merge](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge) is also required in order to validate and propose blocks on Mainnet. Ether is also used as a primary form of collateral in the [DeFi](https://ethereum.org/en/defi) lending markets, as a unit of account in NFT marketplaces, as payment earned for performing services or selling real-world goods, and more.

Ethereum allows developers to create [**decentralized applications (dapps)**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps), which all share a pool of computing power. This shared pool is finite, so Ethereum needs a mechanism to determine who gets to use it. Otherwise, a dapp could accidentally or maliciously consume all network resources, which would block others from accessing it.

The ether cryptocurrency supports a pricing mechanism for Ethereum's computing power. When users want to make a transaction, they must pay ether to have their transaction recognized on the blockchain. These usage costs are known as [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/), and the gas fee depends on the amount of computing power required to execute the transaction and the network-wide demand for computing power at the time.

Therefore, even if a malicious dapp submitted an infinite loop, the transaction would eventually run out of ether and terminate, allowing the network to return to normal.

It is [common](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-lending-insight-idUSKBN25M0GP#:\~:text=price%20of%20ethereum) [to](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bitcoin-slumps-week-low-amid-renewed-worries-chinese/story?id=78399845#:\~:text=cryptocurrencies%20including%20ethereum) [conflate](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/14/tech/nft-art-buying/index.html#:\~:text=price%20of%20ethereum) Ethereum and ether â€” when people reference the "price of Ethereum," they are describing the price of ether.

### MINTING NXS <a href="#minting-ether" id="minting-ether"></a>

Minting is the process in which new NXS gets created on the Nexus ledger. The underlying Nexus protocol can only create the new NXS

NXS is minted when a miner or staker creates a block on the Nexus blockchain. As an incentive to miners or stakers, the protocol grants a reward in each block, incrementing the balance of an address set by the block's miner. The block reward has changed over time &#x20;

### DENOMINATIONS OF NXS <a href="#denominations" id="denominations"></a>

Since many transactions on Nexus are small, NXS has several denominations which may be referenced for smaller amounts. Of these denominations, Wei and gwei are particularly important.

Nexus has colin is the smallest possible amount of NXS. &#x20;



### TRANSACTING NXS <a href="#transferring-ether" id="transferring-ether"></a>

Users can send and receive NXS or tokens using the username:account, namespace::account formats or the register address. Free simple transactions make it really easy.&#x20;

If there is a transaction done within 10 sec of the first transaction then there is a anti-spam fee of 0.1 NXS to prevent spamming the network.

### QUERYING NXS <a href="#querying-ether" id="querying-ether"></a>

Users can query the NXS balance of any account using the Nexus Interface on the user module, account's page where all the accounts are listed with the NXS holdings.&#x20;

[Explorer ](https://explorer.nexus.io)is a popular tool to inspect address balances via a web-based application.&#x20;

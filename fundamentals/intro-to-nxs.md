# Intro to NXS

### WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY? <a href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency" id="what-is-a-cryptocurrency"></a>

A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger.

A medium of exchange is anything widely accepted as payment for goods and services, and a ledger is a data store that keeps track of transactions. Blockchain technology allows users to make transactions on the ledger without reliance upon a trusted third party to maintain the ledger.

The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since Bitcoin's release in 2009, people have made thousands of cryptocurrencies across many different blockchains.

### WHAT IS NEXUS? <a href="#what-is-ether" id="what-is-ether"></a>

**Nexus (NXS)** is the native cryptocurrency of Nexus cosmos. Nexus has free simple transactions due to its design. The purpose of NXS is to allow for appropriate gamification of the network, which  ensures that the active participants are compensated for the stake amount and time spent securing the network. Fees in NXS for various operations also prevent malicious participants from intentionally clogging the network by requesting infinite micro transactions (spamming / DDOS) and name squatting.&#x20;

NXS is created by the protocol as compensation for miners and stakers for providing computational resources and securing the network. Thus the gamification ensures the network participants verify and execute transaction requests and provide computational resources to the network and upgrade these when nece.

Any participant who broadcasts a contract execution request must also offer some amount of NXS to the network as a fee. This fee will be awarded to whoever eventually does the work of verifying the transaction, executing it, committing it to the blockchain, and broadcasting it to the network.

Developers can build decentralised applications(dapps) using the REST API. NXS allows the developers pay for the various operation on the network to make

### MINTING NXS <a href="#minting-ether" id="minting-ether"></a>

Minting is the process in which new NXS gets created on the ledger. The underlying protocol can only create the new NXS. The protocol was designed with a max of 78 million NXS for 10 years and after that there will be tail end emission of a max 3.67%

**Nexus was mined into existence similar to Bitcoin and there was no premine or ICO**.

NXS is minted when a miner or staker creates a block on the Nexus blockchain. As an incentive to miners or stakers, the protocol grants a reward in each block created by them, incrementing the balance of an address set by the block's miner. The block reward reduces gradually over time as per the emission logarithmic scale programmed in the protocol.

### DENOMINATIONS OF NEXUS  <a href="#denominations" id="denominations"></a>

Since many transactions on Nexus are small, Each Nexus has 1 million units or 6 decimal places. A cantrell is the smallest denomination of Nexus

Nexus has colin as the smallest possible amount of NXS. &#x20;

### TRANSACTING NXS <a href="#transferring-ether" id="transferring-ether"></a>

Users can send and receive NXS or tokens using the username:account, namespace::account formats or the account. Free simple transactions make it really easy.&#x20;

If there is a transaction done within 10 sec of the first transaction then there is an anti-spam fee of 0.1 NXS to prevent spamming the network.

### QUERYING NXS <a href="#querying-ether" id="querying-ether"></a>

Users can query the NXS balance of any account using the Nexus Interface on the user module, account's page where all the accounts are listed with the NXS holdings.&#x20;

[Explorer ](https://explorer.nexus.io)is a popular tool to inspect address balances via a web-based application.&#x20;

### The Beginning of Nexus

Nexus was born from a deep desire to build a better world, where Satoshi’s vision of a true decentralized, distributed, global peer-to-peer network could give humanity a better and easier way to transfer financial and informational value. Colin Cantrell, the chief architect and founder of Nexus, sat back in 2013 and watched the evolution of the crypto industry. He saw the strength of on-chain transactions through Proof-of-Work (PoW) and the weaknesses in the Peercoin Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. He witnessed the benefits and limitations of the original blockchain engineering and took the opportunity to rewrite the code from scratch, including the most secure and efficient protocols for scalability and mass adoption.

At this time, the altcoin market was being flooded with scams and pump and dump schemes where coins pushing promises, buzzwords, and the allure of quick profits were used to swindle BTC from communities. Fom Colin’s vision, Coinshield (CSD) was born.

The first CSD block was mined on September 23, 2014 at 16:20 UTC-7, and the project soon-to-be-named Nexus went live. At that point, Coinshield had one channel for mining: a Prime Mining channel (CPU). On October 23, 2014, the second PoW Hashing (GPU) channel was launched. The rewards system included a self-funding mechanism where a portion from each mined block would be sent to one of 13 developer accounts and another portion would be sent to one of 13 exchange accounts. On January 24, 2015, CSD was listed on Bittrex Exchange.

Shortly afterwards, the Core team drafted the first white paper that outlined how the network would recycle and merge the economies and communities of the scam coins. The goal was to help those people, bring them into the CSD community, and help clean up the cryptosphere. The exchange accounts would be used to merge these economies by exchanging the coins for a portion of CSD.

Soon after, Colin announced the intention to rebrand and on July 24, 2015, Nexus version 2.0 was released with Nexus Proof-of-Stake (nPOS) and the introduction of the Trust Network. This laid the foundation for the broader scope of Nexus.

In October 2015, a more formal team was formed to promote development, expand the community, and market Nexus. The ticker symbol was revised to NXS. Discussions on Nexus’s direction led to the decision to abandon the recycling and merging that was part of the Coinshield project. The technical work required to implement the merging was done, but with the explosion in the number of new cryptos, the process would have had little impact. Therefore, Nexus began to develop into something much more expansive. The project had a whole new direction.

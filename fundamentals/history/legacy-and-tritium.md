The crypto market was innovating by leaps and bounds and Ethereum, brought smart-contract ability to blockchain. Nexus has a few innovations of its, but waited to see how things will unfurl.

In 2016 CSD was renamed to Nexus (NXS) and then the team laid the research initiative for a major upgrade to Nexus.&#x20;

In Nov 2019, the Nexus network was upgraded to a ground breaking update called Tritium. and the first block was mined on November,2019. The clahin before the tritium upgrad eis called the legacy chain and this chain still runs linked to the Tritium chain and has been alive, to ensure all the legacy coin holders can migrate to Tritium Chain.

The legacy chain will see a demise at a later stage.

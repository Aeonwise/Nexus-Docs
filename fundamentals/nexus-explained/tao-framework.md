# TAO Framework

Blockchains today are still in its infancy, growing and innovating at a fast pace. To stand out among its peers as a unique and fully decentralised solution, Nexus needs to incorporate the most innovate technology.&#x20;

Nexus started out as a clone of peer coin and in 2016 embarked on an upgrade path to a ground breaking framework called TAO. Nexus views the blockchain as a foundational element of a larger framework. The TAO Framework â€” named for the three phases of deployment: Tritium, Amine and Obsidian.&#x20;

Tritum: It is the foundation of the TAO framework, and along the way a few things were added to the Tritium roadmap which was re-named as Tritium++.

Tritium++: This will bring in the developer tools, mobile wallets and pooled staking and upon completion Tritium will be the fastest single chain.

Amine:&#x20;

Obsidian:

Upon completion of the TAO framework Nexus blockchain will be a 3 Dimensional chain based on a seven-layered software stack modular design, which can scale as needed by the network.

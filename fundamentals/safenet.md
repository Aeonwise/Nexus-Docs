# Safenet

Safenet is the Nexus vision of a truly decentralized internet and the foundation of web 3. The dream of this can be inferred from the design of the software stack which interoperates with the OSI stack.

The grand vision for Nexus is to build the Safenet - a fully decentralized internet owned and operated by people. Safenet will be made up of the Nexus Ledger, ONE stack, LX-OS, Decentralized internet infrastructure consisting of cube satellites, ground stations and ground based mesh networks

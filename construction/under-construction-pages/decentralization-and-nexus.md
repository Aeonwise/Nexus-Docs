# Decentralization and Nexus

_Decentralisation_ is often used as a general term for describing network architectures that more precisely span from decentralised to distributed. Nevertheless, the distinctions are technically significant: the topology of networks (their nodes and their interconnections) determines their properties. One widely referenced classification of network topologies distinguishes between _centralised_, _decentralised_, and _distributed_ networks (Baran, 1964).





In this schematic, **centralised** describes a network with one central node (for example a server), or a cluster of tightly connected nodes, that is connected to all other nodes in the network (clients), while all these other nodes are only connected to this single central node. As a consequence, the failure or destruction of the central node disconnects all nodes from the network, and prevents them from communicating with each other.

In a **decentralised** network, there is a hierarchy of nodes, where nodes at the bottom of the hierarchy essentially are part of a small star network that connects them with a node one level higher in the hierarchy. These nodes are again part of another star network connecting them to the next higher-level node in the hierarchy. Failure of a few nodes in a decentralised network still leaves several connected components of nodes that will be able to communicate with each other (but not with nodes in a different component).

At the other end of the spectrum, **distributed** networks are networks where every node has roughly the same number of connections (called edges) to other nodes. Distributed networks have the property whereby failure of a few nodes (even if they are chosen more or less on purpose) still leaves the network connected, allowing all nodes to communicate with each other (albeit over a possibly much longer path than in the original network).

The more distributed a network is, the more resilient it is overall to various forms of disturbances and the less dependent the network as a whole is on any single node. This also suggests that the network might be less dependent on any particular person, company or organisation that would be operating a particular node. Indeed, the fact that the internet is _decentralised_, but not _distributed_, has become a major technical argument for why governments and technology companies are able to exert more control over it than the internet pioneers envisioned. These properties have granted significant ‘narrative power’ to the distributed network topology

The concepts of centralization / decentralization / distribution can apply to both physical and virtual networks, further strengthening its appeal and applicability. The internet itself is a concrete decentralised network (with actual physical connections between nodes) but we often experience it as a centralised virtual network when we connect to centralised web servers, services and platforms.

The virtual client-server structure, strengthened both through business models and technical means, have allowed companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google to establish highly centralised virtual networks of communications or commerce across decentralised concrete networks. Partly in response to the heavily centralised nature of key online services (search, communication, content distribution), decentralised, or distributed alternatives have been proposed.&#x20;





The above diagram illustrates three different topologies. Centralized and Decentralized are concepts of authority, whereas distribution is a spatial concept, meaning it relates to the physical network topology. A network can be distributed, as well as being centralized or decentralized. An ideal network topology has a decentralized consensus process, with a distributed node topology.

A decentralized cryptocurrency network is a system of many different people using computers or mining hardware, called ‘nodes’ to verify transactions. This type of network is also known as a ‘peer-to-peer network’. None of the nodes or peers have a relative authority over any other. The higher the number of nodes, the more resilient the system is to outside attack or consensus manipulation. Therefore, the more people that contribute resources to a decentralized network, the more secure, resilient, and robust it becomes.

Many blockchains market themselves as decentralized technology. However, ICOs, Security Token Offerings (STO), venture capitalist backing, corporate partnerships, and authoritative consensus implementations, all create favourable conditions for centralization.

Likewise, challenges faced by the original blockchain protocol have also led to cryptocurrencies creating ‘off chain solutions’ that require central nodes or servers. This essentially gives control back to a third-party. Similarly, blockchains that have developed ‘Delegated Proof-of-Stake’ (DPoS) consensus mechanisms have also become more centralized.

### How to check if a project is truly decentralized

Most people believe that everything in crypto world is decentralised, but the reality is completly different, Crypto world is filled with buzzwords and marketing which gives&#x20;

* Decentralized consensus.
* Distributed physical network topology.
* DAO based On-chain community governance.
* Transactions should be Peer-to-Peer (P2P).&#x20;
* No ICO or Premine.
* No Venture Capital (VC) direct funding.
* No single point of centralization in the P2P chain.
* In-built monopolistic safeguards

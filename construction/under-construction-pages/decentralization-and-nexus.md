# Decentralization and Nexus

The above diagram illustrates three different topologies. Centralized and Decentralized are concepts of authority, whereas distribution is a spatial concept, meaning it relates to the physical network topology. A network can be distributed, as well as being centralized or decentralized. An ideal network topology has a decentralized consensus process, with a distributed node topology.

A decentralized cryptocurrency network is a system of many different people using computers or mining hardware, called ‘nodes’ to verify transactions. This type of network is also known as a ‘peer-to-peer network’. None of the nodes or peers have a relative authority over any other. The higher the number of nodes, the more resilient the system is to outside attack or consensus manipulation. Therefore, the more people that contribute resources to a decentralized network, the more secure, resilient, and robust it becomes.

Many blockchains market themselves as decentralized technology. However, ICOs, Security Token Offerings (STO), venture capitalist backing, corporate partnerships, and authoritative consensus implementations, all create favourable conditions for centralization.

Likewise, challenges faced by the original blockchain protocol have also led to cryptocurrencies creating ‘off chain solutions’ that require central nodes or servers. This essentially gives control back to a third-party. Similarly, blockchains that have developed ‘Delegated Proof-of-Stake’ (DPoS) consensus mechanisms have also become more centralized.

### How to check if a project is truly decentralized

Most people believe that everything in crypto world is decentralised, but the reality is completly different, Crypto world is filled with buzzwords and marketing which gives&#x20;

* Decentralized consensus.
* Distributed physical network topology.
* DAO based On-chain community governance.
* Transactions should be Peer-to-Peer (P2P).&#x20;
* No ICO or Premine.
* No Venture Capital (VC) direct funding.
* No single point of centralization in the P2P chain.
* In-built monopolistic safeguards

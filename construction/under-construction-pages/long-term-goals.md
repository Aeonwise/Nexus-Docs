# Long Term Goals

Nexus is establishing the foundation for a Decentralized Web (DWeb) by completely replacing  the internetâ€™s OSI Model and traditional conventions with [The Nexus Protocol.](https://medium.com/@NexusOfficial/a-new-internet-the-nexus-protocol-6ee1e7f533ad) It is driven by a blockchain-based operating system (LX-OS) currently under development, and will be connected by ground stations, distributed satellite constellations and terrestrial mesh networks.

* LX-OS: A hardened [Operating System](https://www.publish0x.com/nexus-blockchain-technical-articles/nexos-the-next-chapter-of-the-nexus-protocol-three-part-seri-xdrowrl) designed to resist attacks from malware, backdoors and similar vulnerabilities through the augmentation of blockchain technology. The first phase will focus on embedded systems (IoT and satellites), with later iterations encompassing consumer hardware UI.
* Satellite & Mesh Networks: A distributed network infrastructure consisting of tokenized micro-satellites, ground stations, and phased array antennas, providing an alternative to centralized Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

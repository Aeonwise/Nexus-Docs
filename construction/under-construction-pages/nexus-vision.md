# Nexus Vision

Unreasonably ambitious and over engineered stands as valid criticism of Nexus’s technical designs and goals. Nevertheless, that energy provides the necessary impetus to pursue an alternative future. Refusing to follow the trend and hype of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), Nexus paved its own path, every passing day affirming these decisions instead of rebuking them. Specifically, the attention to multiple consensus channels, layer one scalability, decentralized identity (DID), quantum resistance and simple Application Programming Interface (API) creates a unified foundation to expand upon.

The culmination is the creation of a fully decentralised internet underpinned by the Nexus blockchain, owned and operated by the people. This internet is not only designed for today but over engineered to last for centuries.  &#x20;

Nexus is establishing the foundation for a Decentralized Web (DWeb) by completely replacing the internet’s OSI Model and traditional conventions with [The Nexus Protocol.](https://medium.com/@NexusOfficial/a-new-internet-the-nexus-protocol-6ee1e7f533ad) It is driven by a blockchain-based operating system (LX-OS) currently under development, and will be connected by ground stations, distributed satellite constellations and terrestrial mesh networks.

* Create the fastest, decentralized layer 1 blockchain, with advanced contracts, to encompass any type of use case with API's or augmented contracts depending on the complexity.
* Create a decentralized search engine which will work on LLD, Nexus Cloud and IPFS.
* Create a decentralized cloud storage system, where network participants running nodes can lease their additional storage to the network. The storage will be powered by the file API and will bring in a lot of utility and compensation for leasing storage to the network.
* Create the fastest, scalable and decentralized 3 dimensional chain which can scale automatically with the growth of the network, will provide better security with checks an balances and also bring the confirmation times for trusted transactions within 5 secs.
* LX-OS: A hardened [Operating System](https://www.publish0x.com/nexus-blockchain-technical-articles/nexos-the-next-chapter-of-the-nexus-protocol-three-part-seri-xdrowrl) designed to resist attacks from malware, backdoors and similar vulnerabilities through the augmentation of blockchain technology. The first phase will focus on embedded systems (IoT and satellites), with later iterations encompassing consumer hardware UI.
* Satellite & Mesh Networks: A distributed network infrastructure consisting of tokenized micro-satellites, ground stations, and phased array antennas, providing an alternative to centralized Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

# Scaling - 3DC

The Three-Dimensional Chain (3DC) is designed to solve the 'Blockchain Trilemma'. It will transform the ledger into a multi-layered processing system, in order to scale securely and with a high degree of decentralization. The Blockchain Trilemma is an opinion that only two of the three qualities, Security, Decentralization and Scalability, are achievable concurrently.

The 3DC chains together cryptographic primitives into a three dimensional immutable object (a 3D block), and has three core dimensions: reputation channels (X), immutability or authenticity (Y), and time (Z). This architecture is being deployed through the [TAO framework](https://nexus.io/ResourceHub/roadmap).

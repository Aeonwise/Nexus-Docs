# Nexus and Web 3.0

Nexus will be the preeminent blockchain to shape and redefine web 3.0, this can be attributed to our vision and ethos which makes decentralization as the cornerstone and enables P2P as the default way of transacting.

### Crypto and Web 3.0?

Web3 is a buzzword tossed around by all the blockchain protocols, claim it as a revolution. Decipher them and we find these chains are in their own silo's. The internet is the main infrastructure which enables our entire digital world. This internet is not decentralized, plagued with issue like net neutrality, privacy,  and is more like a gated community, where each government has different rules and regulations like the great firewall in China. ISP's can block any traffic and make life difficult.\


The essence of web3 is decentralization, token based economy and enabling ownership of the underlying asset. **`Is it possible to create a web3 ecosystem on top of the centralized internet, controlled by the very corporations who own Web2 and regulated by the authoritarian and sovereign government's?`**

Essentially every protocol blockchain is creating their own island or siloed network  and interoperability is similar to bridges across these islands.&#x20;



### Why Nexus Will Redefine Web3

Nexus was born as a cryptocurrency in 2014, watching the innovations and developments in crypto,  realization dawned that unless the internet was not decentralised, any blockchain built on top will not be able to stand the test of time. It also realised that creating a new internet was  inconceivable and monumental task.

The Nexus team developed the TAO framework which was designed as a 7  layer software stack,  interoperable with the OSI stack. &#x20;

The only way is create a real web3 will start with building the decentralized &#x20;

* Fully decentralized design and community run powered by a DAO.
* Anti monopolisation safeguards built-in.
* No key management for users and with SigChains and mobile wallet helps with wide scale adoption.
* Build in hybrid mode for privacy conscious applications and this also helps with horizontal scaling.
* Nexus enables Peer-to-Peer on-chain transactions and with wallet modules can integrate more functionality into the wallet.
* Nexus enables ownership of&#x20;

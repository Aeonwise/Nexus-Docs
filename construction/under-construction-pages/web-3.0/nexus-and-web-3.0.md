# Nexus and Web 3.0

Nexus will be the crypto vanguard to architect and build the real web 3.0; completely decentralised, token based economics and will enable people to own and govern the network. This can be attributed to our vision, ethos based on a decentralized foundation and enables P2P as the default way of transacting.

### Crypto and Web 3.0?

Web3 is a buzzword tossed around by all the blockchain protocols, claim it as a revolution. Decipher them and we find these chains are in their own silo's. The internet is the main infrastructure which enables our entire digital world. The internet is not decentralized, plagued with issue like net neutrality, privacy,  and is more like a gated community, where each government has different rules and regulations like the great firewall in China. There are a lot of trusted parties in the internet experience like ISP's, domain providers, certificate authorities and even then the internet is in shambles, even thought normal people do not face issues.\


The essence of web3 is decentralization, token based economy and enabling ownership of the underlying asset. **`Is it possible to create a web3 ecosystem on top of the centralized internet, controlled by the very corporations who own Web2 and regulated by the authoritarian and sovereign government's?`**

Essentially every protocol blockchain is creating their own island or siloed network, and interoperability is similar to bridges across these islands. All these will be at the mercy of the centralised internet providers.&#x20;



### Why Nexus Will Redefine Web3?

Nexus was born as a cryptocurrency in 2014, watching the innovations and developments in crypto,  it was evident that unless the internet was decentralised, any blockchain built on top will not be entirely decentralized. We also realised that creating a new internet was an inconceivable task and only innovation can make this possible.

To secure a decentralised internet, requires a highly scalable blockchain which had to be designed first, with ease of use for the average user to transact easily and abstracted from complexities. The Nexus team developed the TAO framework which was designed as a 7-layer software stack,  interoperable with the OSI (Open System Interconnect) stack. We are now running Tritium,  the foundational layer of the framework and when the TAO is completed it will be a 3-Dimensional blockchain which can scale as per the usage.

Starting out as an independent internet network was never an option, the whole world is already wired into the existing internet. The only viable option is to start from the existing internet using the existing infrastructure and then branch out with interoperability to the new decentralized infrastructure.&#x20;

To better understand safenet, we can divide into software and hardware. We will delve deeper into each one of them.&#x20;



### Software:

Safenet will require it's own protocols, stacks, routing, CDN, Certificate Authorities (CA), Domain Naming Services (DNS), storage and Operating system (OS).&#x20;

Nexus has been designing all the required software implementations. Nexus Protocol (NP) is the protocol which will replace Internet Protocol (IP), ONE stack will replace the OSI stack and compliments the Nexus 7-layered software stack.&#x20;

Safenet will be interoperable with the existing internet, initially will use IP4 overlay to run its own Nexus Protocol as underlay and build the various software components and then deploy its own decentralised infrastructure to expand Safenet. This internet will use  blockchain for maximum security and also the latest tools to build a solution which can last for centuries.

The last two years Nexus released the Nexus Protocol whitepaper, this replaces the Internet Protocol (IP). The ONE stack will replace the OSI stack, LISP which is a locator, identifier separation protocol and LX-OS will be the operating system, intertwined with the Nexus blockchain for added security to power the decentralised internet infrastructure. A lot of architectural work has been completed at the backend, even then there is a long road ahead.

Data is a crucial part of the internet, along with data privacy, Nexus has designed its own decentralized cloud storage solution named "Nexus Cloud" which will be enabled by the File API. The data will be scattered with redundancy across the nodes on the network, this helps secure the network and incentivises people for the services and time. Accessing storage using API's is the easiest and convenient way for dapp developers. This will create utility for NXS.

Domain Name Services (DNS)  and Certification authorities (CA) will be replaced by decentralised systems based on Nexus blockchain.&#x20;



&#x20;

### Hardware:

The internet infrastructure is what make the internet possible.  Fibre cables across the oceans connect continents and hardware routers keep the internet humming. Nexus will build its internet infrastructure, which will be powered with  LEO satellites which will connect to each other and will relay to ground stations. Phased array antennae will make it easier to&#x20;





The only way is create a real web3 will start with building the decentralized &#x20;

* Fully decentralized design and community run powered by a DAO.
* Anti monopolisation safeguards built-in.
* No key management for users and with SigChains and mobile wallet helps with wide scale adoption.
* Build in hybrid mode for privacy conscious applications and this also helps with horizontal scaling.
* Nexus enables Peer-to-Peer on-chain transactions and with wallet modules can integrate more functionality into the wallet.
* Nexus enables ownership of&#x20;

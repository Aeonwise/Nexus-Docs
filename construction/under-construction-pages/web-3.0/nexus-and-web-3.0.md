# Nexus and Web 3.0

Nexus will be the crypto vanguard to architect and build the real web 3.0; completely decentralised, token based economics and will enable people to own and govern the network. This can be attributed to our vision, ethos based on a decentralized foundation and enables P2P as the default way of transacting.

### Crypto and Web 3.0?

Web3 is a buzzword tossed around by all the blockchain protocols, claim it as a revolution. Decipher them and we find these chains are in their own silo's. The internet is the main infrastructure which enables our entire digital world. The internet is not decentralized, plagued with issue like net neutrality, privacy,  and is more like a gated community, where each government has different rules and regulations like the great firewall in China. There are a lot of trusted parties in the internet experience like ISP's, domain providers, certificate authorities and even then the internet is in shambles, even thought normal people do not face issues.\


The essence of web3 is decentralization, token based economy and enabling ownership of the underlying asset. **`Is it possible to create a web3 ecosystem on top of the centralized internet, controlled by the very corporations who own Web2 and regulated by the authoritarian and sovereign government's?`**

Essentially every protocol blockchain is creating their own island or siloed network  and interoperability is similar to bridges across these islands.&#x20;



### Why Nexus Will Redefine Web3?

Nexus was born as a cryptocurrency in 2014, watching the innovations and developments in crypto,  realization dawned that unless the internet was decentralised, any blockchain built on top will not be able to be decentralized. It also realised that creating a new internet was an inconceivable task.

The Nexus team developed the TAO framework which was designed as a 7  layer software stack,  interoperable with the OSI stack. Tritium is the foundational layer of the framework and it has been going strong from November 2019, when the first tritium block was mined.&#x20;

The last two years Nexus released the Nexus Protocol (NP) whitepaper. This protocol replaces the Internet Protocol (IP). The ONE stack will replace the OSI stack and LX-OS will be the OS, intertwined with the Nexus blockchain for added security, will power the decentralised internet. A lot of architectural work has been completed at the backend, even then there is a long road ahead.

Nexus will also build the internet infrastructure where today undersea fibre optic cables connect the various parts of the world, we will be launching LEO satellites which will connect to other and will relay to ground stations. &#x20;







The only way is create a real web3 will start with building the decentralized &#x20;

* Fully decentralized design and community run powered by a DAO.
* Anti monopolisation safeguards built-in.
* No key management for users and with SigChains and mobile wallet helps with wide scale adoption.
* Build in hybrid mode for privacy conscious applications and this also helps with horizontal scaling.
* Nexus enables Peer-to-Peer on-chain transactions and with wallet modules can integrate more functionality into the wallet.
* Nexus enables ownership of&#x20;
